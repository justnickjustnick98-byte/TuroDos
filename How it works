What Is a DoS Attack?
_____________________________
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a system, server, or network unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming it with excessive traffic or resource requests.

Instead of exploiting a vulnerability to gain access, a DoS attack focuses on disrupting availability.

DoS vs DDoS

DoS: Attack originates from a single source.

DDoS (Distributed DoS): Attack originates from multiple devices (often a botnet).

DDoS attacks are significantly more powerful and harder to mitigate.
